<h2 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m MatÃ­as!</h2>

<h4 align="center">Software Developer | Electromechanical Engineer</h4>

<p>
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in starting my career as a Software Developer! I began studying the basics of programming in <em>Python</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>, and <em>TypeScript</em>. With the clear objective of becoming a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>, I started learning <em>Angular</em>, <em>Ruby on Rails</em>, and <em>PostgreSQL</em>, sophisticated technologies that allow me to understand the development of a web application from Front-End to Back-End.
</p>

<p>
I'm very excited and eager to have the opportunity to work in software development teams with the determination, dedication, and commitment that define me!
